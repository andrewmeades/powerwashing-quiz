        "id": 31, 
        "type": "mc", 
        "question": "Which solvent is best for removing a silicone-based sealer?", 
        "options": ["Water", "Xylene", "Mineral Spirits", "Digesters"], 
        "answer": "Mineral Spirits (or Naphtha)", 
        "explanation": "Silicone is non-polar. You need a non-polar solvent. Xylene is often too hot (evaporates too fast); Mineral Spirits has the dwell time needed to swell the silicone."
    },
    {
        "id": 32, 
        "type": "tf", 
        "question": "True or False: You should wet a wall before applying an acidic cleaner.", 
        "answer": "True", 
        "explanation": "Pre-wetting fills the pores with water, preventing the acid from soaking deep into the brick where it can't be rinsed out. It forces the chemical to stay on the surface."

    {
        "id": 33, 
        "type": "open", 
        "question": "What is the 'Dwell Time' rule for enzymatic cleaners?", 
        "answer": "They must stay wet and warm.", 
        "explanation": "Enzymes are living proteins. If they dry out or freeze, they stop working. They often need 15-45 minutes of wet contact to digest the oil/starch."
    },
    {
        "id": 34, 
        "type": "mc", 
        "question": "What creates 'Green Vanadium Staining' on white brick?", 
        "options": ["Algae", "Copper oxide", "Acid reacting with Vanadium salts", "Grass stains"], 
        "answer": "Acid reacting with Vanadium salts", 
        "explanation": "Many white/buff bricks contain Vanadium. Cleaning them with Hydrochloric acid turns the salts green. You must use a specialized cleaner (like citric) or neutralize immediately."
    },
    {
        "id": 35, 
        "type": "open", 
        "question": "Why is 'run-down' a danger when cleaning windows above masonry?",

        "id": 36, 
        "type": "tf", 
        "question": "True or False: A 40-degree nozzle concentrates pressure more than a 15-degree nozzle.", 
        "answer": "False", 
        "explanation": "The smaller the angle (15 degree), the smaller the area, and the higher the impact force (PSI) on that specific spot."

    {
        "id": 37, 
        "type": "open", 
        "question": "What is 'Laitance' on new concrete?", 
        "answer": "The weak, milky layer of cement dust on the surface.", 
        "explanation": "It creates a false bond. If you paint over laitance, the paint sticks to the dust, not the concrete, and will peel off."
    },
    {
        "id": 38, 
        "type": "mc", 
        "question": "Which surfactant charge is best for general dirt/grease removal?", 
        "options": ["Cationic", "Anionic", "Non-ionic"], 
        "answer": "Anionic (Negative Charge)", 
        "explanation": "Most dirt/surfaces are slightly negative, but anionic surfactants lift particulate matter effectively via repulsion and suspension. (Dish soap is anionic)."
    },
    {
        "id": 39, 
        "type": "open", 
        "question": "Why use 'Hot Water' for oil stains (First Principles)?", 
        "answer": "Lowers viscosity and increases reaction rate.", 
        "explanation": "Heat excites the oil molecules, making them flow easier (viscosity drops), and doubles the chemical reaction speed for every 10°C increase."

        "question": "What is the primary ingredient in 'Rust Remover' (like F9 BARC)?", 
        "answer": "Phosphoric or Oxalic Acid.", 
        "explanation": "These acids reduce Iron Oxide (Rust) into a soluble iron salt that can be rinsed away."

    {
        "id": 42, 
        "type": "mc", 
        "question": "If you mix Bleach (SH) and Ammonia, what gas is produced?", 
        "options": ["Chlorine Gas", "Mustard Gas", "Chloramine Gas", "Oxygen"], 
        "answer": "Chloramine Gas", 
        "explanation": "Highly toxic. Never mix different cleaning chemicals. Ammonia is found in glass cleaners and urine."

        "question": "Why does 'Shadowing' occur after pressure washing concrete?", 
        "answer": "Inconsistent gun distance or speed.", 
        "explanation": "If the nozzle is 2 inches from the surface, then 4 inches, the cleaning power drops by 4x (Inverse Square Law), leaving dirty stripes."
    },
    {
        "id": 44, 
        "type": "tf", 
        "question": "True or False: Soda Blasting generates heat that can warp metal.", 
        "answer": "False", 
        "explanation": "Soda blasting is unique because the soda particle explodes on impact, absorbing energy (endothermic), which actually cools the surface. Great for thin sheet metal."

        "type": "open", 
        "question": "What is the 'Water Hardness' impact on detergents?", 
        "answer": "Minerals (Ca/Mg) consume the soap.", 
        "explanation": "The soap binds to the minerals instead of the dirt. You need to use more soap or add a water softener to 'chelate' the minerals first."
